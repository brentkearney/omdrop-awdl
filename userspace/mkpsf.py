"""Build an AWDL Periodic Synchronization Frame body, field by field.

Validated against Wireshark's AWDL dissector (packet-awdl.c, contributed by
SEEMOO's Milan Stute): all seven TLVs parse with zero malformed, and every field
decodes with correct semantics -- Master Channel 6, AW Period 16 TU, Presence
Mode 4, Step Count 3, Self Metric 60, Country Code X0, Social Channel Map =
channel 6.

    mkpsf.py --body   # hex of the AWDL body
    mkpsf.py          # text2pcap-able full 802.11 frame

Re-check after any edit:
    mkpsf.py > f.txt && text2pcap -l 105 f.txt f.pcap
    tshark -r f.pcap -V | grep -c Malformed        # must be 0

The body starts at awdl_hdr_t (type, version, sub_type, rsvd, phy_timestamp,
fw_timestamp -- 12 bytes). Category 127 and the 00:17:f2 OUI are supplied by the
firmware: awdl_af_hdr reads back ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff 7f 00 17 f2.

A bare 12-byte header parses as a valid header but a MALFORMED frame -- the
dissector wants the TLV chain -- so a header-only template would be dropped by
any real AWDL receiver.

Written from published field descriptions (Broadcom's wlioctl.h, the Wireshark
dissector, SEEMOO's papers), NOT from owl's GPLv3 source.
